# Jobless Increments

The goal of the program is to increment the value of the variable x from 0 to 5 using different methods. I did quite a few methods.
I will add more as I get time.

## Things which you can do
- Clone or Fork it
- Add your own methods but the goal should be same as above
- Feel free convert it to your favourite programming language
- Show me what you did [@MainstreamFrost](https://twitter.com/MainstreamFrost) on Twitter.

> This code does not serve any real purpose but we can code for fun right?
